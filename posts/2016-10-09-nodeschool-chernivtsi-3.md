# NodeSchool Chernivtsi #3

_9 Oct 2016_

Yesterday we had third **NodeSchool** event in Chernivtsi! So it's time to summary up everything.

## Preparation

Now we decided to make workshop about basics of JavaScript and prototype model. I proposed to add [stream-adventure] workshopper, but other mentors thought it would be too much. Well at this time we were gonna do these two workshoppers:

* [javascripting]
* [planetproto]

Besides, we've got a cool partner — [**Bukovyna Innovative Technology Cluster**][cbit] or just **Cbit**. We agreed to be information partners. Thank you, guys, for sharing our event!

My company, [**ELOGIC Commerce**][elogic] provided financial support. Special thanks for [Paul Okhrem](https://www.facebook.com/puncher).

[**Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics (FMI)**][fmi] gave us a good place for our event.

## Talks

[**Serhiy Boreyko**](https://twitter.com/jestersunborn) have talked about _"History of JavaScript"_. Slides: [slides-javascript]

[**Denis Zavgorodny**](https://twitter.com/DenisZavgorodny) have a talk _"The Basics of Prototype Inheritance"_. Slides: [prototype-slides]

## Photos

Here was a problem. Our photographer has force majeure circumstances, so there will _not_ be photos from event :(

But, there are some photos from social networks:

## Feedback

That was the first event when we ask people to fill the feedback form. We received a lot of positive responses. In short:

* About 80% people rated our event as _good_ and _amazing_.
* The next event, apparently, will be all about ES2015.
* The complexity of the material is OK.

The full report is available here: [NodeSchool #3 Feedback.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzBDsDGBGK3HV2V4MEVUbnNGTW8/view?usp=sharing)

## Conslusion

I'm very grateful to everyone who had come. I hope you spent your time with benefits for you. Se you soon on the next event!
