# bash-handbook got 200 ★’s on GitHub

_22 Jan 2016_

> **UPD:** It's hard to believe, but now bash-handbook has _more than 2000 stars_! And it's still growing up!

About month ago, in New Year night, I started to write my first handbook — [the bash-handbook][bash-handbook].

To be honest, I wrote this book for myself so as to not forget the bash basics and summarize my experience of writing shell scripts. I was trying to publish new chapters every few days. So now, a month later, bash-handbook gets 200 ★’s on GitHub and it shows me that my efforts wasn't in vain:

I'm very grateful to [Jorge Bucaran](https://github.com/bucaran) and [Andrey Polischuk](https://github.com/andrepolischuk). Jorge have corrected my grammar mistakes, since I'm not native English speaker and thanks for Andrey bash-handbook now has awesome update notifier:

[Thanks everyone](https://github.com/denysdovhan/bash-handbook/stargazers), who think it’s useful and everyone, who have made this book better!

**P.S:** I'm gonna use this book in next NodeSchool Chernivtsi meet-up, so currently I'm working on [learnyoubash](https://github.com/denysdovhan/learnyoubash) interactive workshopper, which will be based on this book. Click «Watching» to keep in touch.
