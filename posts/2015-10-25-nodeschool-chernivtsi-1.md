# NodeSchool Chernivtsi #1

_25 Oct 2015_

Hi, everyone! Yesterday, we had our first **NodeSchool** event in Chernivtsi and it was amazing! I this post I'm gonna tell you about this…

## Preparation

Preparation this event was continuing for 4 weeks. I should say that these weeks were spent not for nothing. We've got nice stickers:

Thanks for **Chernivtsi National University** we've got place, projector and Wi-Fi hot-spots.

## Workshop

At first event, members were passing two main workshops:

* [`javascripting`][javascripting] — the basics of JavaScript.
* [`learnyounode`][learnyounode] —  the basics of node: asynchronous i/o, http.

I am pleased that the community is very gladly accepted our idea. Just for node, we've planned first event for 20-30 members, but came more than _a hundred_!
