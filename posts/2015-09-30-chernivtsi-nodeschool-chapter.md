If you don't know, Chernivtsi is my hometown — I live here since 2000 year. I love my city and I love JavaScript also. So, what if I combine these things? And I combined them…

Therefore, meet [**Chernivtsi NodeSchool**][che-ns] chapter! Now, if you live in Chernivtsi, wait for our first workshop event!
