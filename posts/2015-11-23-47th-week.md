## 21 November, Saturday

Today I should had to act on the concert dedicated to 30 anniversary of the founding of the International Federation of [Combat Hopak][combat-hopak]. The concert was scheduled for 18pm, so my day was like this:

* The morning I met on the Lviv Railway station. The weather was terrible: rain and snow.
* From 5am to 9am I was sleeping at the station. It seemed like I'm homeless (lol):
![Me at the Lviv Railway Station](http://cs629328.vk.me/v629328400/23a8a/WpqpgitoMm4.jpg).
* Almost nothing from 9am to 12am.
* I went for a walk around the downtown of Lviv, along with my team.
* Finaly, I went to Lviv High Castle. The landscape from there is amazing, despite the fog and rain:

* From 18pm to 23pm were celebrations and after that we've gone to the "Communa" at Square Rynok. It started to rain:

* We were waiting for the train at 5am, so I fell asleep:

## 22 November, Sunday

* I woke up at 4am. It was very cold. We got a taxi to the Railway station, boarded the train and headed home.
* In the train I fell asleep again.
* We got home around 12am.
* As soon as I've got home, I fell asleep, because sleeping in the train is nightmare.
* After all, I went back to my small projects.
* Release mdast-typographer@0.2.0.
* 5 commits to [md-typographer][mdt].
* Pull requests:
  * [Add watch task.][pull16]
