# 2016's summary

_31 Dec 2016_

The last day of the year and it's time to summarize everything that I had. This year I have a good starting point for making summary. I wrote a tweet with goals a year ago:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="uk"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">To-do for this year:<br>- Finally buy MacBook<br>- Find a girlfriend<br>- Make smth really awesome and open source<br>- Organise few meetups.</p>&mdash; Denys Dovhan (@denysdovhan) <a href="https://twitter.com/denysdovhan/status/682869749404057600">Dec 1, 2016</a></blockquote>

## Events

Now, a year later, I can take a look back and summarize this year up:

* Entered in 2016 year disappointed - I was not allowed to enter the United States 🇺🇸.
* I had started to write a handbook — [_📖 bash-handbook_](git.io/bash-handbook). I've been really excited, when this [handbook got 200⭐️](/bash-handbook-200-starts). A few days after [**Jorge Bucaran**](https://twitter.com/jbucaran) shared a link to this book on Reddit. As a result, the book hit the tops of GitHub and got 2K⭐️ for two days (now it has about 2.6K⭐️). Translated to: 
  - 🇵🇹 [Portugal](https://github.com/denysdovhan/bash-handbook/blob/master/translations/pt-BR/README.md) (thanks to [**Eduardo Rabelo**](https://twitter.com/oieduardorabelo))
  - 🇹🇼 [Traditional Chinese](https://github.com/denysdovhan/bash-handbook/blob/master/translations/zh-TW/README.md) (thanks to [**Peng Jie**](https://twitter.com/bivinity))
  - 🇨🇳 [Simplified Chinese](https://github.com/denysdovhan/bash-handbook/blob/master/translations/zh-CN/README.md) (thanks to [**Shuai Liu**](https://twitter.com/liushuaikobe))
  - 🇰🇷 [Korean](https://github.com/denysdovhan/bash-handbook/blob/master/translations/ko-KR/README.md) (thanks to [**Sungjin Kang**](https://github.com/ujuc))
* Proposed [**Terry Sahaidak**](https://twitter.com/terrysahaidak) to translate a book together. The choice fell on [_"Understanding ES6"_](https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read) by [Nicholas C. Zakas](https://twitter.com/slicknet). During the year, we tranlsated and published the chapter of our translation. Special thanks to [**Marianna**](https://twitter.com/marianna_ch_a) and [**Sasha**](https://twitter.com/nevusnews). Check out [our translation](understandinges6.denysdovhan.com).
* Inspired by the success of bash-handbook I created an interactive workshopper - [_learnyoubash_](https://git.io/learnyoubash). Now it has 162⭐️.
* Made a migration of my [_dotfiles_](https://github.com/denysdovhan/dotfiles) to oh-my-zsh. I've made a significant and major upgrade with many steep pieces.
* Created a [_⭐️ 🚀 spaceship-zsh-theme_](https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-zsh-theme) — now it's one of the most popular project by me. Now it has 236⭐️.
* Made an utility for generating a short links using git.io: [_gitio-zsh_](//git.io/gitio-zsh)
* In Dec 31, [**Anton Shuvalov**](https://twitter.com/shuvalov_anton) proposed me to take a lead on [_@jsunderhood_](https://twitter.com/jsunderhood) — this is a collective twitter-accout for JavaScript-developers with a new author every week. I agreed. My week was from Dec 22 to Dec 28. It was amazing experience of communicating with a lot of developers: a steady stream of questions, discussions, debates, a lot of new material. The archive of my week: [@denysdovhan](//jsunderhood.ru/denysdovhan)
* Organized [_NodeSchool Chernivtsi #2_](http://denysdovhan.com/nodeschool-chernivtsi-2) workshop. There weren't enough participants. Workshopper about Bash was extremely difficult for most of people.
* Finally tried React in practice and wrote the first simple project.
* Created a simple workshopper about Markdown — [_how-to-markdown_](//git.io/how-to-markdown). It was included in NodeSchool's core-workshoppers and thanks for that I've been invited to [workshopper](https://github.com/workshopper) organization later.
* I started hanging out in [dev-ua](https://github.com/dev-ua) community. 
* Joined to [15×4 community](https://15x4.org). Loved this idea and decided to help. Later had a talk about how the Internet 🌍 works.
* My parents started to build a house 🏡. Throughout, I worked in construction - a great relaxation after intellectual work.
* In April, bought a MacBook Pro 13 " 💻🍎.
* Visited 2 local meet–ups:
  - «IT Weekend» by SoftServe
  - «JSDay» by MobiDev
* Created a simple site for [_NodeSchool Chernivtsi_](//nodeschool.io/chernivtsi).
* In June, joined the [_Node.js Foundation_](//nodejs.org) . I've been working as a part of nodejs-uk team. We were translating Node.js site to Ukrainian 🇺🇦. Now I am a team maintainer there.
* [I was interviewed](//chv.tv/u-proekti-ne-vidomi-aktyvy-chernivtsiv-denys-dovgan.html) by the local newspaper about my success with _NodeSchool Chernivtsi_.
* I really wanted to get to the conference. People with dev-ua chipped in on my ticket 🎫 to OdessaJS - for me it was a nice unexpected gift 🎁:

* Gathered many cool stickers for MacBook.
* After returning from Odessa, I went to the camp 🏕. Slept in a sleeping bag, looked at the stars through the sight of a sniper rifle, fired from a bow/crossbow/gun, climbed the mountain 🏔.
* Right from the camp went to her grandmother 👵🏻 in the village. I read books 📚, went through the fields 🌾.

  - Found new sponsors and partners
  - Was on local TV
* I helped to organize the dedication of first year students 👨🏻‍🎓 in my University. 2 days in mountains 🏔, in quite extreme environment with thunderous music and drunk and inadequate crowds of young students. I spent the whole evening in the arbor and talked with [**Renata**](https://twitter.com/rocket3dragon).
* In September–October I've been bruning out. Felt constant fatigue, weakness, nausea, had no appetite and taste. Felt mentally broken. Saw no purpose in life. Didn't see  goals in outlined future. Heavily suffered from loneliness. Here is a huge thanks for supporting to [Ivan Akulov](https://twitter.com/iamakulov), [Vladimir Starkov](https://twitter.com/iamstarkov) and [Masha](https://twitter.com/marusia_18_).
* Received an offer from [**Eugene Obrezkov**](https://twitter.com/ghaiklor) to speak at _TechTalks_ meet-up in Kharkiv, but declined due to lack of time and mental problems.
* In Oct 3 got an offer by [**Stanislav Termosa**](https://twitter.com/_termosa). He offered  to give a talk at [_KharkivJS_](https://twitter.com/KharkivJS). I've decided to talk about [JavaScript Shells](//denysdovhan.com/slides-javascript-shells) 🦐🐚. I was added to speaker's chat. The first thought I got after that was: “What have I forgot among these smart guys?”
* Two-theree weeks and slides were done. Me and [**Serhiy Boreyko**](https://twitter.com/jestersunborn) took this path: Chernivtsi — Kyiv — Kharkiv — Kyiv — Chernivtsi.
* In the train to Kharkiv we saw [**Paul Miller**](https://twitter.com/paulmillr). He was running in the train in mask of Guy Fawkes.
* Had my first English talk for about half thousand people:
